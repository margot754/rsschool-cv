## About Me:

I have been working in the central bank of the Russian Federation for 4 years. For 3 years as a system administrator I was engaged in local network support. Supported of database servers and application servers. For the last year I have been a devops engineer. I am involved in application deployment with Jenkins, use and wrote dashboards on graphana and splunk. I work with Oracle and basic sql. I've been looking at the future of my current job for a long time and I've decided that web development would be much more satisfying for me. In my spare time I've been doing some layout work. I made a couple of layouts, acquired basic knowledge of javascript and now I found your school and this course. I hope that I will be motivated enough to successfully complete the course and start my professional path in frontend development.
